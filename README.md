# Calculator with Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Converter

This calculator is implemented in Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The core functionality includes the ability to perform basic arithmetic operations and convert mathematical expressions to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) using the Shunting Yard algorithm.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The calculator provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to input expressions using buttons and see the results on the display.

- **Arithmetic Operations:** It supports standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **RPN Conversion:** The calculator employs the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert mathematical expressions to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). RPN is a postfix notation that simplifies expression evaluation.

## Implementation Details

- **Programming Language:** Python

- **User Interface Library:** Tkinter

- **Core Algorithm:** Shunting Yard Algorithm for converting infix expressions to RPN.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Tkinter library

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Execute the Python script implementing the calculator.
